# Coding Challenges

This repo is my personal space for working through programming challenges from different reliable sources such as [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) and others.

---

### Structure

Each challenge has its own folder with:

* the implementation
* a README explaining the problem and my approach

---

### Why

The goal is to tackle **at least one challenge per week**, taking the time to dig deep into how things actually work.
It’s not just about solving problems — it’s about building a stronger understanding of what’s happening under the hood and leveling up as a developer step by step.

### Completed Challenges

* [x] wc clone — counts lines, words, bytes, and characters

More will be added as I go.
